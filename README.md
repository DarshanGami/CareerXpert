# Job-Matching Platform

## Project Overview

The Job-Matching Platform is a web-based application designed to connect job seekers with potential employers, streamlining the hiring process. The platform enables job seekers to find relevant job opportunities based on their skills, experience, and preferences, while employers can post job openings and search for qualified candidates. Our goal is to simplify the job search and recruitment process, making it efficient, transparent, and user-friendly.

## Features

- **Job Search**: Advanced search filters to help job seekers find opportunities that match their skills, experience, and location.
- **Profile Management**: Both job seekers and employers can create, update, and manage their profiles with relevant details.
- **Job Posting**: Employers can post job listings, detailing the roles, responsibilities, and required qualifications.
- **Application Management**: Job seekers can apply for jobs, track their applications, and receive notifications.
- **Matching Algorithm**: Smart matching algorithm that suggests suitable candidates for job listings based on various parameters.
- **User Authentication**: Secure sign-in and registration for job seekers and employers.
- **Admin Dashboard**: An admin panel to manage users, job postings, and platform content.
