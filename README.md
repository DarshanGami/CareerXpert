## Project Overview

The Job-Matching Platform is a web-based application designed to connect job seekers with potential employers, streamlining the hiring process. The platform enables job seekers to find relevant job opportunities based on their skills, experience, and preferences, while employers can post job openings and search for qualified candidates. Our goal is to simplify the job search and recruitment process, making it efficient, transparent, and user-friendly.
